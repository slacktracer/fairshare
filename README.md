# shareplus

Easy, simple and fast share to Google Plus.

Click it to open a new tab to share your current page on Google Plus.

I made this extension for myself and right now (2017-01-03) it's the simplest it can be.

## Why?

I used to use the official Google +1 Button to share on Plus but the popup style was slow and failed sometimes. Also, I had to wait there for it to open before I could change to other tab or do something else.

(I still use it to +1 a page, I just don't then wait for the popup to come up.)

To me, personally, the easiest way to share is to open a new tab. Whenever it's ready I can go back to it and press the Share button.

The same goes to the default YouTube "Share to Google+" button. Sometimes I can open two of them, sometimes a new one "overwrites" a previously opened one. (I don't know why. I did not took the time to find out.)

## What else?

I made this for myself and that's what I'm gonna be using to share to Plus from now on. You're welcome to do the same.

I suppose I will eventually improve it somehow. Ideas (and pull requests) are welcome.
